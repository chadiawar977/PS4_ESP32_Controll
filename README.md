# PS4_ESP32_Controll
Control A 4-wheel vehicle with steering using a PS4 controller using a ESP32 microcontroller 

To use this code you need to have Arduino IDE installed and install the ESP32_Bluepad32 board. 
Then install the bluepad32 library and USB host shield library

This code use throttle (R2) to make the robot go forward, brake (L2) to make the robot go backward both of these signals are a PWM signal.

The left joystick is responsible for steering.

We utilized the X , square and triangle buttons to control a shooting mechanism mounted on top of the robot.
